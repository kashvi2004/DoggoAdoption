# DoggoAdoption
The “AdoptADoggo” project was conceived in response to the growing need for an efficient and 
user-friendly platform that connects prospective dog adopters with animal shelters and rescue 
organizations. Traditional methods of dog adoption often involve cumbersome processes, limited 
visibility for shelters, and inadequate information for adopters, leading to lower adoption rates and 
prolonged stays for dogs in shelters.
